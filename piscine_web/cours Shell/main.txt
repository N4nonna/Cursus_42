basic command:

ls - list of element in current folder
cd - comand directory, used to move from a directory to another
mkdir - create a directory
cp - copy file
mv - move file into another directory
touch - create a file
nano - create/open/write on a file
cat - read a file
echo - write in terminal (create an echo-o-o-o-o)
chmod - change authorisation of file/folder
rm - remove file
man - manuel of usage

options:
most of comands use options (accessible via man) to perform different actions
to do a command with option we append "-[OPTION]" to the comand line
we can add more than one option (if they are compatible)

pipe:
somethimes we want to perform multiple actions at the same time
for that we use a pipe "|"
[COMMAND A] | [COMMAND B]
when command A is done, command B will be triggered
ex: ls -l | echo "done"
